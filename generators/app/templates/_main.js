   *     accessed in a stripped down context for the sole purpose of refreshing

  /**
   * Primary method called when Tableau is asking for your web data connector's
   * data. Takes a callable argument that you should call with all of the
   * data you've retrieved. You may optionally pass a token as a second argument
   * to support paged/chunked data retrieval.
   *
   * @param {function(Array<{object}>, {string})} registerData
   *   A callback function that takes an array of objects as its sole argument.
   *   Each object should be a simple key/value map of column name to column
   *   value. For example, you might call the callback in the following way:
   *   registerData([
   *     {'String Column': 'String Column Value', 'Integer Column': 123}
   *   ]});
   *
   *   It's possible that the API you're interacting with supports some mechanism
   *   for paging or filtering. To simplify the process of making several paged
   *   calls to your API, you may optionally pass a second argument in your call
   *   to the registerData callback. This argument should be a string token that
   *   represents the last record you retrieved.
   *
   *   If provided, your implementation of the tableData method will be called
   *   again, this time with the token you provide here. Once all data has been
   *   retrieved, pass null, false, 0, or an empty string.
   *
   * @param {string} lastRecord
   *   Optional. If you indicate in the call to registerData that more data is
   *   available (by passing a token representing the last record retrieved),
   *   then the lastRecord argument will be populated with the token that you
   *   provided. Use this to update/modify the API call you make to handle
   *   pagination or filtering.
